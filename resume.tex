		\section{{INDUSTRY PROJECTS}}
    \noindent\rule[0.5ex]{\linewidth}{1pt}
		{\bf Ingestion API} \hfill \vspace{3pt} \\
			The Ingestion API is designed to function as the middle man between independant programs orchestrated by Apache Airflow that collect data, and multiple postgres database connections. This API was built with golang.

		{\bf Ingestion Index Crawler} \hfill \vspace{3pt}\\
			This crawler is designed to reduce search times of already ingested data. It crawls all instances for a specified user, and produces a list that can be easily and quickly searched. Built using Docker and Selenium in python.

		\section{{PUBLIC PROJECTS}}

		{\bf Metroidvania} \\
			\emph{github.com/thenick775/metroidvaniafangame} \hfill \vspace{3pt}\\
			This project is a small game written in Objective-C that utilizes features from Spritekit, GameplayKit, AVAudioPlayer, and JSTileMap. I have written all of the event driven animation scheme, collission detection, character physics, data storage schemes, and game logic.

		{\bf Terbine Map Visualization} \\
			\emph{github.com/thenick775/Terbine-Map} \hfill \vspace{3pt} \\
			This was a fun exercise in data visualization, where fixed coordinate data points in Terbine were plotted and connected on an interactive world map. The data mining was done using Selenium in python, and data visualization was accomplished using Mapbox in R.
